This class will not be much of coding and anything - ONLY DESIGNING

So the class will be two parts :
 1. PART 1 : Designing the WEBPAGE
 2. PART 2 : CODING THE WEBPAGE


PART 1 -----------------------------------------------

Topics to be covered :-
  1. Basic Typology
  2. Basic Colors
  3. Introduction to UI/UX
  4. User Experience (UX)
  5. UI/Frontend Design
  6. UI/Frontend Development
  7. Web Interactions and Animations 
  8. Branding (good to know)
  9. Resource Pool



1. TYPOLOGY   : FIGMA SPACE
   -> inter regular 16px is the FONT and 16px is recommended for most of the devices  
   -> Overuse of font weight makes your design wierd
   -> Typographic Jargon  
       a. Leading (line Hieght)  : 120% for body text and 150% for Heading text
       b. Tracking (Inter Spacing) : -3% to 0%
       c. Kerning 
    -> See resources
    -> At the end : design should be legible and readable


2. COLORS 
   -> Color Theory
   -> Read notes 
   -> See resources    
   -> See Video 


3. UI/UX  [UX without UI is like brain without body AND UI without US is like human without its brain]
   ->  UI : everything you see on the page 
       UX : everything you feel on the page
   -> Get as many info from website from first few secs : Therefore the HERO and landing page should be very imp
   ->  Minimal Animations : do not distract the user

4. UI [core concepts]
   a. Hierarchy
      -> TYPES  :  Visual and Content
      -> Key Elements : Size, Color, Position, WhiteSpace

   b. Consistency
      -> TYPES : Visual, Functional, Internal, External

   c. WhiteSpaces [negative spaces]
   d. Continuity : Gestalts principle of continuity : users tend to precieve elements that are arranged on a line or curve as related.   


5. UX [Some basic laws]
   a. Hick's Law
      -> don't provide lots of option in single view

   b. Fitt's Laws
      -> time to reach a target depends on its size and distance

   c. Jakob's Law
      -> user tend to follow similar designs
      
   d. Miller's Law
      -> max no. of card in grid cannot exceed 7 [this is working memory of human]
      -> If you have so many items go for pagination

   e. Law of Proximity
      -> Objects close to each other are precieved as related

   f. Asthetic-Usability Effect
      -> Users preceive visually appealing designs as more usable


DOING DESIGNING : WOHOOoooooooooooooo
Medical Professional Website  - ASTRONOMICAL WEBSITE - BIMAL WEBSITE

So, doing VIMAL website : zuban kesari -> naming it BIMAL (parody)  -> GO TO FIGMA

CONTINUING PART 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------

1. over the head of website OR above the head
2. no. of words in a line are supposed to be 13 or 14 
3. Frame vs rectangle  => frame is div in HTML and rectangle is like just a shape

next environment => ![use proper semantic tags](image-1.png)


![Design This](image.png)
add tailwind to codebase, and add extension for resolvinh tailwind classes to code (using cursor IDE)
![nav bar](image-2.png)

ANIMATION : framer motion everything

tailwind color pallet

no code frontend -> framer or webflow

![HeRO sections](image-3.png)


Making website Responsive : So when you use flexbox your website becomes automatically very responsive for larger amd medium sized devices, as flexboxes resize themselves accordingly, they are life savers.But for smaller devices for breakpoints we still need to make this website responsive

See animation tutorials from the resources of slides

BRANDING is very necessary  => see website brandingGuidlines

TODO :-
1. __Lummi.ai__ : generates good pics
2. bento grid => this is grid which is aligned in wiered way yet looks clean
3. yes some companies still use react but most of them are now moving to nextjs and something new came remix
4. a very good css resource ![alt text](image-9.png)
5. go through this : ![alt text](image-10.png) and ![alt text](image-11.png) and ![alt text](image-12.png)

example of sticky => ![alt text](image-13.png)
